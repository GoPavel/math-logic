Repository contains homework tasks from math logic course.

Requirement: alex, happy

## hw0. [Expression parser](https://github.com/GoPavel/math-logic/tree/master/hw0)

Parses proposition with the following grammar:

```
Expr ::= Disj | Disj '->' Expr
Disj ::= Conj | Disj '|' Conj
Conj ::= Term | Conj '&' Term
Term ::= '!' Term | '(' Expr ')' | Name
Name = [A-Z] [A-Z 0-9]*
```
Lexer is generated by [alex](https://www.haskell.org/alex/) and Parser is generated by [happy](https://www.haskell.org/happy/)

### Example
input:
```
P->!QQ->!R10&S|!T&U&V
```
output:
```
(->,P,(->,(!QQ),(|,(&,(!R10),S),(&,(&,(!T),U),V))))
```

## hw1. [Proof Checker for proposition](https://github.com/GoPavel/math-logic/tree/master/hw1)

Checks given proof of a proposition and annotates each line deducing necessary rules.
Complexity: O(N)

### Example

input:
```
A,B|-A&B
A
B
A->B->A&B
B->A&B
A&B
```
output:
```
(1) A (Prop. 1)
(2) B (Prop. 2)
(3) (A)->((B)->((A)&(B))) (Ax. 3)
(4) (B)->((A)&(B)) (M.P. 3, 1)
(5) ((A)&(B)) (M.P. 4, 2)
```

## hw2. [Deduction theorem](https://github.com/GoPavel/math-logic/tree/master/hw2)

Implementation of proof deduction theorem: transform given proof of Γ,A⊢B to Γ⊢A->B

input:
```
A|-B->A
A->B->A
A
B->A
```

output:
```
|-(A)->(A)
(A)->((A)->(A))
((A)->((A)->(A)))->(((A)->(((A)->(A))->(A)))->((A)->(A)))
((A)->(((A)->(A))->(A)))->((A)->(A))
(A)->(((A)->(A))->(A))
(A)->(A)
```

## hw3. [Completeness theorem for propositional calculus](https://github.com/GoPavel/math-logic/tree/master/hw3)

Implementation of completeness theorem for zeroth-order logic: checks a1,a2,..,an ⊨ phi and builds the proof of a1,..,an ⊢ phi. 

input:
```
B,W|=A->B
```
output:
```
B,W|-A->B
B->A->B
B
A->B
```
input:
```
|=!A&!B
```
output:
```
Proposition is false for A=T,B=F
```

## hw4. [Check properties of lattices](https://github.com/GoPavel/math-logic/tree/master/hw4)

Checks that reflexive transitive closure of given graph is lattice with necessary properties.

Checked [lattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_(order))'s properties:
- join-semilattice: each two elements has a least upper bound (i.e. `+`/`v` is completely defined) 
- meet-semilattice: each two elements has a least lower bound (i.e. `-`/`∧` is completely defined)
- distributivity
- implicativity
- Boolean algebra: forall A . A+!A=1

input:
```
5
2 3 4
5
5
5
5
```

output:
```
refutation of destributivity: 2*(3+4)
```

## hw6. [Convert Heyting algebra to Kripke model (in progress)](https://github.com/GoPavel/math-logic/tree/master/hw6)

Gets intuitionistic proposition and Kripke model which refutes that. Returns Heyting model that refutes the proposition.
